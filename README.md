**Peripheral Visions: The Birth and Evolution of Japanese Imperialism (1850-1937)**

### Introduction
*This course aims to familiarize students with the burgeoning literature on the origins, development, and demise of Japanese imperialism (1850-1937)*. In the wake of the diplomatic humiliation of the ‘unequal treaties’, Japan embarked on a society-wide reform effort aimed at asserting its position in the voracious late 19th century world order. An overhaul of its political, military judicial, economic,… systems was crafted after cherry-picked Western “examples”. 
After driving back Western advisers, exchange bankers and diplomats whom the Japanese identified as agents of Western power and interests, Meiji-reformers also began copying the center-periphery distinction into Japan's own sphere of interest. The aim was “to become the Great-Britain of the East”. This embedding of Western narratives of domination into Japanese own storytelling remains a deceptive and little understood process; its understanding is at the heart of the proposed course. Through topics as punishment, representation, and policies related to narcotics, the course also touches upon historiographical developments as gender, the history of the body,and so on.

Importantly, the course also serves a secondary, more encompassing objective. Disappointed with traditional analyses centering on human agency, it attempts to identify deeper, underlying forces that do not only constrain human choice, but that turn out to possess a self-propelling dynamic and, by their very nature, show themselves to transcend the semantics of the nation state and related categories (national culture, etc.). More specifically, students are invited to (re)think *communication media* (radio, telegraph, photography, …) and a range of technologies (financial, judicial, military, scientific) as the origins, catalyzers and even objectives of development and struggle in modern world society. A central tenet of the course is therefore to link historiographical findings with the interdisciplinary fields of [media studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_studies), [systems theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann), and so on.

### Structure:
Every session will start by an outline of the respective debates by the professor. This intends to provide a framework for consecutive discussion. In terms of content, discussions will concentrate on both theoretical/methodological and historiographical matters. Central to the course is the notion of 'hacking' history: students are encouraged to develop a free and original problem-consciousness with respect to topics to be tackled, and especially make use of all sorts of electronic tools, databases, languages, … The students’ willingness to identify problems and construct problem solutions also entails a willingness to go beyond historiography, and include include literature from related disciplines (sociology, anthropology, ethnography, …).

From session 2 on, small student groups will be assigned to introduce topics to be discussed. This may include both historical matter and/or their contemporary implications. Particular attention will be paid to the 'politics of memory', i.e. the use(s) of history in the period of their formulation, and how to judge them. The center versus periphery dynamic, which is at the heart of this very course's topic, then reappears in the epistemological dimension: how does history-writing in the (non-English?) periphery differ from 'established' versions, and why? What does this reveal about the nature of ‘accepted’ versus ‘revisionist’ viewpoints? 

### Teaching model:
Arguably much more important than the professor's introductions are the student's reading notes, his/her active contribution to the discussions, and his/her presentation(s). Especially welcomed are individual contributions in terms of materials 'under the radar', neglected tools and sources (both databases and primary/secondary materials), and original uses of known search tools. Again, be creative! As the digital era has disturbed traditional distinctions between text and other types of information (everything is bits-and-bytes), the inclusion of audio-visual material is encouraged, as is discussion of sources in the languages of the region under discussion (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, …)
You are strongly encouraged to talk to the professor and teaching assistant while planning your discussion session.

### What is asked from students?
1. To participate in the course as a whole: doing the essential reading for each week’s topic, and coming prepared to question and intervene.
2. Providing written and oral comments.
3. Researching, writing, presenting, defending your argument and choice of topic to be discussed.
4. When presenting, students should go beyond the narrow content of the reading to be presented; develop an argument as a coherent whole, e.g. by focusing on theoretical issues (e.g. the relationship between (political) power and violence, methodological ones (for instance the nature of the relationship between ‘ideas’ and the material/technological/… contexts in which they are shaped)

### Evaluation... 
... will be based on:
reading notes, class discussions (other means of evaluation may be discussed with the students).
**There is no paper to be written; instead, students are asked to make ‘smart’, elaborate and interactive presentations. They are responsible for putting the presented reading in context, and act as ‘moderator’ for the follow-up discussion.**

### Readings:
Everyone should read the ‘required’ items; I have deliberately (mostly) picked shorter items (journal articles and/or book chapters). Discussants also need to read at least some of the ‘other’ readings. As the introductory reading, I propose:
  * Ballantyne, Tony, and Antoinette Burton. 2014. *Empires and the Reach of the Global*. Harvard University Press.
